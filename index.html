          <h2>Adventure Background</h2>
          <p>
            Ragged Hollow is a quaint little town in a remote and secluded area of the Kingdom. It is best known for its flax, which is pulped into paper and used to make books at the Temple of Halcyon, or made into cloth and oil (each family owns a loom and an oil press used during the long winter evenings). The town and its 500 inhabitants are governed by a council of priests from the temple. There is no army or town guard.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the west lies a mountainous region dominated by Mount Mourn that no one ever goes into. To the north across the Rime River is the Gloam Wood, a deep dark forest that one generally avoids exploring. To the south stretch the notoriously ill-famed Wailing Hills, an area few enter willingly, though a trail leading to a few frontier villages some three days’ walk away does cross through them. To the east begins the Kingdom, where the first important city is a week away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generally, a Ragged Hollow resident never goes farther than a day's walk round-trip, except when they are doing their Halloo, which is likely to be the only adventurous time of their life. And by most accounts, that's just fine: life at Ragged Hollow is rustic and laborious, but all in all peaceful and rewarding.
          </p>

          <h3>The Halloo</h3>
          <p>
            In Ragged Hollow, as in most towns and villages in the region, the Halloo is that period of freedom and insouciance that separates youth from maturity. When the time comes, young men and women take up their walking sticks and set out from a few weeks to a full year. They walk along the roads and trails and stop at inns or camp in the meadows. They earn the money they need to keep going by doing odd jobs for farmers and craftsmen. This is a fondly remembered time, during which strong friendships are made with strangers and other hallooers.
          </p>

          <p>
            They then return home to the life their parents led before them. “All too soon the Halloo ends and the youth is over.”

        <article id="about-vagabond" class="card" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
  <h2>About Vagabond</h2>
          <p>
            Drawing on medieval romance, dungeon synth, and fifty years of classic dungeoncrawlers, Vagabond is a fast-paced action RPG where Players become daring Heroes delving into dungeons and thwarting villains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vagabond focuses on the Heroes’ choices, not the villains’ dice luck. In Vagabond, enemies don’t roll; they succeed unless the Heroes intervene. Your actions and failures drive the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social interaction is pure roleplay. The system emphasizes quick Combat and fluid Exploration. Fights are short, deadly, and cinematic. Sometimes a single blow ends an encounter, and clever ideas can topple bosses.
            The game encourages bold action. Don’t be sword shy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rulings should favor momentum and the Heroes’ experience. When in doubt, choose the option that keeps the story moving.

        <article id="about-srd" class="card" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
          <h2>What is OSR</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Decision making as the core player experience: Solutions are in the world and not always on the character sheet.</li>
            <li>Open, dynamic environments leading to interesting situations (and no scripted stories)</li>
            <li>Referee as a neutral interface between the world and the players.</li>
            <li>Referee rulings over detailed rules for every single edge case.</li>
            <li>Absence of “game balance” to make the world more believable and dangerous.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="generators" class="card" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
          <h2>Danger Level</h2>
          <p>
            This isn't a “fair and balanced” adventure, but the PCs can almost always choose whether to fight or back off.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many opportunities for combat, but players can often explore areas and complete interactions without any combat at all, depending on their choices. To state this clearly: combat should be a last resort unless it is on the player’s terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            They may set up ambushes and traps, find allies (or recruit retainers), and use diversions to lure dangerous monsters away from the party’s goals. Wise adventurers don’t risk their lives lightly!
